## 📌 Overview

Clipboard-based attacks are an underrepresented but critical class of endpoint threats. Malicious software silently monitors the system clipboard to intercept passwords, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, OTPs, and financial credentials — often without any user awareness.

This project implements a lightweight **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** agent focused entirely on clipboard security. It operates as a background process, continuously monitoring clipboard state, classifying copied content by risk level, and enforcing configurable response actions — alerts, auto-clear, and event logging.

**Core attack vectors this tool defends against:**
- **ClipBanker / Clipboard Hijackers** — malware that swaps copied crypto addresses with attacker-controlled ones
- **Credential Harvesting** — passive clipboard sniffing for passwords and tokens
- **Accidental Data Exposure** — users unknowingly pasting sensitive data into untrusted applications

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor clipboard activity in real-time across Windows and Linux
- Detect sensitive data using extensible pattern-based analysis
- Classify detected data into risk levels (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Prevent leakage through configurable alerts, auto-clear, and logging
- Provide a functional, demonstrable proof-of-concept for endpoint DLP
- Document real-world attack scenarios and threat model for academic analysis

## 🔍 Detection Engine

The analyzer uses a multi-pattern regex engine to identify sensitive data categories:

| Data Type | Pattern Example | Default Risk Level |
|---|---|---|
| 💰 Crypto Wallet Address (BTC) | `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2...` | 🔴 Critical |
| 💰 Crypto Wallet Address (ETH) | `0x742d35Cc6634...` | 🔴 Critical |
| 🔑 Password-like Strings | High entropy + special chars | 🔴 High |
| 💳 Credit Card Numbers | `4111 1111 1111 1111` | 🔴 High |
| 🔐 API Keys / Tokens | `sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA...` | 🔴 High |
| 🔢 OTP / 2FA Codes | 4–8 digit standalone | 🟡 Medium |
| 📧 Email Addresses | `user@domain.com` | 🟡 Medium |
| 📱 Phone Numbers | Local + international formats | 🟡 Medium |
| 🌐 Private IPs / Internal URLs | `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x` | 🟢 Low |
| 📄 Generic Sensitive Keywords | `password`, `secret`, `token` | 🟢 Low |

## 🚨 Response Matrix

| Risk Level | Alert | Auto-Clear | Log |

## 🧪 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cryptocurrency Address Swap Attack

```
1. User copies their BTC wallet address to send funds
2. ClipBanker malware silently replaces it with attacker address
3. ❌ Without tool: User pastes attacker address → funds lost
4. ✅ With tool: Tool detects crypto address, alerts user, clears clipboard
```

### Scenario 2: Accidental Password Copy

```
1. Developer copies database password from config file
2. Switches window, pastes into Slack chat by mistake
3. ❌ Without tool: Credential exposed in chat logs
4. ✅ With tool: High-risk alert triggered on copy → user prompted before paste
```

### Scenario 3: API Key Leakage

```
1. User copies AWS access key (AKIA...) from terminal
2. Tool detects AKIA prefix pattern → Critical risk
3. ✅ Auto-clear fires after 3 seconds with desktop notification
```

## 📝 Logging Format

All events are logged in structured format for analysis and thesis reporting:

```
[2025-07-14 14:32:11] CRITICAL | Type: BTC_ADDRESS | Action: CLEARED | App: chrome.exe
[2025-07-14 14:35:42] HIGH     | Type: PASSWORD    | Action: ALERTED | App: notepad.exe
[2025-07-14 14:40:03] MEDIUM   | Type: EMAIL       | Action: LOGGED  | App: outlook.exe
```

Log fields: `timestamp`, `risk_level`, `data_type`, `action_taken`, `source_application`

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Regex-based detection produces false positives on high-entropy random strings
- Cannot inspect clipboard content from elevated/privileged processes on some OS configurations
- Auto-clear may interfere with legitimate workflows if thresholds are too aggressive
- No deep content inspection (file buffers, image data, rich text objects)
- Linux clipboard hook support depends on X11; Wayland has limited clipboard API access

---

## 🔬 Threat Model

This tool is designed against the following attacker profile:

- **Attacker position:** Unprivileged malware running in user context on the target machine
- **Attack goal:** Silent clipboard exfiltration or address substitution
- **Known malware families:** ClipBanker, Trojan.CliptoShuffler, ComboJack, Evrial
- **Out of scope:** Kernel-level keyloggers, hypervisor attacks, hardware implants

---

## 📚 Future Improvements

- ML-based content classification to reduce false positives
- Integration with enterprise DLP platforms (Symantec, Microsoft Purview)
- Behavioral analysis: detect clipboard polling by third-party processes
- Encrypted clipboard vault for secure temporary storage
- Cross-device clipboard sync with end-to-end encryption
